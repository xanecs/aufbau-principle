# Aufbau Principle

The Aufbau Principle is a method of figuring out the electron configuration of an
atom in its neutral state.
This method is not perfect as there are 20 exceptions (transitive metals).

## This program

To use this program you need node.js. No additional dependencies.

Call it with the atomic number as the only argument.

```
node index.js 53
```

This will return `1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p5`
which is the electron configuration of element 53, Iodine.
